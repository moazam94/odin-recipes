    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are coated in a mixture of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried to a golden brown, and finished in a lovely cream sauce. A side of pasta would be good with this, or try mashed potatoes. A green vegetable and a salad will complete this dinner menu, nicely!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenders</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>parchment paper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat chicken tenders with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour on a shallow plate. Place beaten eggs into a shallow bowl. Combine grated Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1 teaspoon smoked parika, and place on a second shallow plate.</li>
            <li>Cover a dinner plate or platter with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Dip each tender in flour, shaking off excess. Next, dip in beaten eggs, allow excess to drip back into bowl. Place each tender into panko mixture, scoop mixture onto tenders with  dry fingers. Place on the parchment-covered plate. Repeat with remaining ternders.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tblspn butter and 2 tblspn olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until butter is bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time, being careful not to crowd. Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no longer pink in the center, 3 to 4 min per side.</li>
            <li>Turn tenders when the crust is nicely browned and continue cooking until thermometer reads at least 165°F (74°C). Adjust heat accordingly if crust is getting too brown, and add more oil or butter if the skillet looks dry. Remove cooked chicken to cooling a rack.</li>
            <li>Add garlic to the skillet, and stir 30 to 45 seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine, stirring all the brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Season Italian seasoning blend and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Stir in cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring frequently, and adjust flavor with salt and pepper if needed. Allow sauce to bubble until desired consistency is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return cooked tenders to the skillet and warm in the sauce, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Lastly, garnish with fresh parsley and TADA!</li>
        </ol>
